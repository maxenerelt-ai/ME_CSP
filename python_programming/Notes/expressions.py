# ME 6th Expressions Notes

# What is an algorithm?
    #A set of instructions to accomplish a specific task
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hello", name)

#Algorithm for Area
length = 5
width= 20
area = length * width
print(length, "X", width, "=", area)

#List steps in an algorithm
    #1.determine variables needed 2.Complete processes needed 3.provide an output

#List all of the different mathematical operators(Give me the symbol and tell me what it does)
    # + = add, - = minus, *= Times, / = division

num1 = 234
num2 = 293
num3 = 42
num4 = 325
average = num1+num2+num3+num4
answer = average/4

print(num1, "+", num2 , "+", num3 , "+", num4, "=", answer)
