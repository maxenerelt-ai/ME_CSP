/*
What is a loop? 
    Code that can be run continually until a specific condition is met / true
What are the two types of loops?
    For and While loops
What is iteration
    repetitive block of code
What are arrays? 
    A list of names or words
How do you make lists in C? 
    setting your data type, setting how many, and curly brackets, and also comma in between each example( item int num[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}; )
How do you make for loops in C? 
    for(int x = 0; x < 11; x++){
        printf("%d\n", nums[x]);
How do you make while loops in C?
    By using while instead of for and putting parenthesees and curly brackers
