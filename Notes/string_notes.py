sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

first_name = input("Whats your first name?\n").title()

last_name = input("Whats your last name\n").title()

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print("Welcome to my program", full_name + "!")

#Stupid Proofing 
    #Strip .strip() gets rid of spaces from the start and the end
    #.upper() turns whole thing too upercase letters .lower() makes all lowercase
    #.capitalize() makes first letter capital .title() makes every first letter per space capital
    # To get rid of space use +
